# IMDb-Info-on-Netflix
A Tampermonkey script to display the IMDb info of Netflix movies and series

To see the the rating for a movie or series, simply over the series
and open the preview, the script will automatically find the title
and the rating on IMDb. Once a rating has been obtained, it is
stored in the local storage to avoid making that request again
and thus making it faster to see the rating later on.
Clicking on the IMDb logo opens the IMDb page in a new tab.
